# CCProject5_Digital-Divination

This is a web-based interactive experience designed to relieve everyday concerns through a playful form of digital divination. Users are asked to reflect on their worries by answering three short questions. Based on their input, the system generates a randomized piece of advice from an online API. The goal is to encourage reflection, emotional release, and a touch of humor through simple human-computer interaction.
